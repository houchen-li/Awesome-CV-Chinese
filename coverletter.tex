\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
This is Houchen Li, a Chinese student who has been in Germany for a long while to study computational fluid dynamics. As I saw your job request, I realized this offer would be an essential position that I should never ignore.

Let me first start with my knowledge background. My major field is computational physics. And my main programming languages are C, C++, Python. I have 8 years coding experience on Linux. In the past, I was focusing on matrix operation such as big matrix inversion, big matrix decomposition, big matrix eigenvalues determination. And I also have experience to deal with minimum searching, parameters optimization, stochastic process, fluid visualization. I believe these knowledge could be broadly used in data science. And my math level can help me good handle that.

\lettersection{Why ECPS?}
As far as I know, EPFL is one of the most famous university of Europe. And the field of ECPS is highly consistent to what I learnt in master degree study. Now ECPS is responsible for Channelflow v2.0 package. I once played with this package in my master degree study. I highly agree with the philosophy of your team. I hope to contribute to that.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Indeed, I am not a graduate from mechanical engineering or computer science. But I am sure I can provide another kinds of approaches to the engineering problems by using advanced math and physics skills. In fact, physics research is about finding solutions for the very fundamental problems. In the past 8 years, I was asked to solve a lot of models on computer. Now I hope to promote my career into the broader region.

In addtional, I have a good sense of history. I like to know how human civilization goes in such a way. In my opinion, human society is a highly chaotic interacting system. I would spend time to investigate how individuals get along with others.

%My germany language level is not at C1. But I have very good English skill. If necessary, I will try my best to improve my German language level. I am not afraid of language study.
